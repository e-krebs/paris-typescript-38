# Demo for Live-coding during [Paris Typescript #38](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/paris-typescript/events/300591093/)

- the `main` branch is the starting point of the live-coding demo
- the branch `feat/simple-implementation` includes the solution
- the branch `feat/route-params` includes a solution which works with route param (⚠️ advanced Typescript)

# running the project

to run the project you first need to install [bun](https://bun.sh)

then run:

- `bun install` to install dependencies
- `bun run dev` to run the server in dev mode

> this project is simple enough that it should work well with other package managers. There is just no lockfile for those.
